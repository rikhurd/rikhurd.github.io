I'm a recent graduate from Karelia University of Applied Sciences where I studied for Business Information Technology with a huge passion towards problem solving and all kinds of technology.

My programming experience is mainly in web development and C++ game programming.

Game Development is a hobby I got interested about since I have always liked games and was curious how they were made. Through my hobby of game development, I aim to improve my programming and problem-solving skills.
