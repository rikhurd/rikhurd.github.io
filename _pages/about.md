I'm a recent graduate from Karelia University of Applied Sicences where I studied for Business Information Technology with huge passion towards programming and problem solving.

Expeirence I have is mainly in web development, but I would like to deepen my experience in software programming and programming in general.

Game Development is a hobby I got interested about since I have always liked games and was curious how they were made. Through game development hobby I wish I will become better programmer too.
