## What and why?
{: .accordion-section-header}

  <div class="accordion-section-content">
    <p>
      Game Jams are events where participants try to make a video game in a limited time and usually with a given prompt that is tied into the game they are making. In this Bigmode Gamejam 2023 the prompt was <b>MODE</b> and time limit was 20 days. Game Jams themselves are usually relaxed where the participants are hobbyist looking forward to meeting new people or putting their development skills to test.

      For a long time I have been curious, but never really had time to commit into a Game Jam, but finally I made my debut within Bigmode Game Jam 2023. The main reason I joined was to work with other people. I have made some small game projects, but having a team member that can do art and audio elevates the game into a new height. Also meeting new people that have the same hobby and similar mindset was something I was really looking foward to.
