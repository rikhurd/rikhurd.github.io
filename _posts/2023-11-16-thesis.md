## Basis

In my thesis I examined further development of the minigames implemented for an escape room game. Escape room is a team-based game, where the players encounter challenges that are performed within a time limit. The escape room includes three different mini-games, which have been developed using the Unreal Engine 4 game  engine. Areas of further development include additions requested by client, bug fixes and problems detected during development. Implementations that were made were, for example, level editor and level additions to one minigame. This thesis works as a commission for the University of Eastern Finlandâ€™s project, the purpose of which was to develop computational thinking (CT).

Why I chose this project as my thesis was because I wanted to deepen my knowledge on these same technologies that were used to develop this project. I have also developed this project earlier in a course focused on project work during my studies, which made me even more interested in it. Also I have interest to work in a large-scale projects which this project fulfilled. There were new things I did want to learn from this like working with servers and
