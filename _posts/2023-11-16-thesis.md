First section describes the starting point of this project and why I chose this topic as my thesis. Feel free to skip it and go to the [technical implementation](#technical-implementations-and-fixes) first.

## What and why?

  <div class="accordion-section-content">
    <p>
      In my thesis I examined further development of the minigames implemented for an escape room game. Escape room is a team-based game, where the players encounter challenges that are performed within a time limit. The escape room includes three different mini-games, which have been developed using the Unreal Engine 4 game  engine. Areas of further development include additions requested by client, bug fixes and problems detected during development. Implementations that were made were, for example, level editor and level additions to one minigame. This thesis works as a commission for the University of Eastern Finlandâ€™s project, the purpose of which was to develop computational thinking.

      Why I chose this project as my thesis was because I wanted to deepen my knowledge on these same technologies that were used to develop this project. I have also developed this project earlier in a course focused on project work during my studies, which made me even more interested in it. Also I have interest to work in a large-scale projects which this project fulfilled. There were new things I did want to learn from this like working with servers and

## Technical implementations and fixes

In this section I will go over some of the most important implementations and changes I did in this project. In addition to what is written here I have also done numerous bug fixes and smaller changes. For example minigame not being completed and custom server logs overriding itself.

### Maintenance system minigame's level editor

I did a simple level editor which would enable for the user to create levels for this minigame without a need of a programmer.
